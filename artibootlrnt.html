        <p class="my-4">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
        <p>A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.</p>

        <h2 class="col-sm-2 my-3">HTML</h2>
        <p class="col-sm-10">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. When used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS and JavaScript, it creates the vast majority of content seen on websites. HTML is used for a huge variety of things on the web, from building complex websites that offer email and calendar functions to constructing a simple course website or resume. </p>

        <div class="row my-2">
        <h2 class="col-sm-2 my-5">CSS</h2>
        <p  class="col-sm-10">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects. CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>

        <div class="row my-2">
        <h2 class="col-sm-2 my-3">Bootstrap</h2>
        <p  class="col-sm-10">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Essentially, Bootstrap saves the stress of writing lots of CSS code, giving more time to spend on designing webpages. It’s also FREE! It’s currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com/twbs"> GitHub</a> and can be downloaded easily from the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">official site.</a></p>
